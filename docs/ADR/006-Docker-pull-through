# Docker Pull throught

# 001  architecture consideration

## Status

Accepted

## Context

docker hub get a pull limit if somebody go wrong on our infrastructure we can get quickyly this limit solution will be to implement a pull throught proxy.


### Decision

create two container task to create a dockerhub pull through and a ghcr one 

we can add these registry to traefick to have both under the port 5000 but this will add a traefik dependancy on rebuild

so to begin we will use one trafick service on two diferent static port

## Consequences

- this registry need to be start first on cluster creation
- need to update all job image with local proxy url

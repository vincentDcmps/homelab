# NAS

## 001 New Nas spec

### Status

In progress

### Context

Storage:

- Data filesytem will be in btrfs.
- Study if keep root filesystem in EXT4.
- Need to use LVM over btrfs added posibility to add cache later (cache on cold data useless on beginning maybe write cache in future use).
- hot Data (nomad, document,fresh download file,music?) on SSD cold DATA on HDD (film, serie photo)
- at least 2 HDD and 2 SSD



Hardware:

- network 2.5 gpbs will be good for evolve
- at least 4go ram (expansive will be appreciable)

Software:

be able to install custom linux distrib

### Decision

- Due to form factor/consumption and SSD capability my choise is on ASUSTOR Nimbustor 2 Gen 2 AS5402, he corresponding to need and less expensive than a DIY NAS
- buy only a new ssd of 2to in more to store system and hot data

### Cosequence

need to migrate Data and keep same disk 

- install system
- copy all data from 2to HDD to SSD then format 2to HDD
- copy download data to FROM 4 to HDD to SSD
- copy serie to 2to HDD and copy film on external harddrive
